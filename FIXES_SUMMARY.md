# TeaTime App - Database and Authentication Fixes

## Summary of Issues and Fixes

The TeaTime app was encountering database errors during user registration, particularly the error "relation public.profile does not exist". We've implemented several fixes to resolve these issues and ensure proper user profile handling.

## Issue 1: Table Name Mismatch

**Problem:** The code was looking for a table named `profile` (singular), but the actual table in the database schema is named `profiles` (plural).

**Solution:** 
- Updated the auth context to correctly reference the `profiles` table
- Created a reset database script to ensure all tables are named correctly

## Issue 2: Database Schema Mismatch

**Problem:** The user registration process was trying to insert fields that didn't match the database schema.

**Solution:**
- Fixed the database schema to clearly separate:
  - `users` table (personal info like name, bio, etc.)
  - `profiles` table (stats and activity data like streak count)
- Updated the `signUp` function to insert data into both tables with the correct fields

```typescript
// Create user entry
const { error: userError } = await supabase.from('users').insert([
  {
    id: data.user.id,
    email,
    full_name: name,
    bio: '',
    // other user fields...
  },
]);

// Create profile entry
const { error: profileError } = await supabase.from('profiles').insert([
  {
    id: data.user.id,
    username,
    streak_count: 0,
    // other profile fields...
  },
]);
```

## Issue 3: Missing or Incorrect RLS Policies

**Problem:** Row Level Security policies were not properly set to allow users to insert their own data.

**Solution:**
- Added proper RLS policies for user data insertion:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own data"
  ON public.users FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile"
  ON public.profiles FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
```

## Issue 4: Inconsistent Profile Service

**Problem:** The Profile service didn't correctly join the users and profiles tables.

**Solution:**
- Updated the Profile type to reflect the actual data structure:
```typescript
export type Profile = {
  // From profiles table
  id: string;
  username: string;
  streak_count: number;
  // ...other profile fields

  // From users table
  email: string;
  full_name: string;
  bio: string | null;
  // ...other user fields
};
```
- Fixed the database queries to properly join the tables:
```typescript
.from('profiles')
.select(`
  id,
  username,
  // ...other profile fields
  users!inner (
    email,
    full_name,
    // ...other user fields
  )
`)
```

## Issue 5: File Upload Paths

**Problem:** Avatar upload paths weren't organized by user ID, potentially causing conflicts.

**Solution:**
- Updated the file paths to include user ID for better organization:
```typescript
const filePath = `${userId}/${fileName}`;
```

## Key Changes Made

1. Created a `reset-database.sql` script to properly set up all tables
2. Updated the `auth.tsx` signup function to handle both users and profiles tables
3. Fixed the profile service to correctly work with the dual-table structure
4. Added proper instructions for database setup and troubleshooting
5. Ensured consistent field names across all code and database tables

## Testing the Fixes

After applying these fixes, users should be able to:
1. Register new accounts successfully
2. See their own unique profile data
3. Have separate feeds, friends lists, and notification systems
4. Upload profile images
5. Submit tea entries

Each user's data is now properly isolated, ensuring that Alice's profile, feed, and friends are separate from Ben's.

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Data Migration**: If there was existing user data, it would need to be migrated to the new schema
2. **Session Handling**: The app now correctly redirects based on authentication state
3. **Profile Completeness**: New users should be encouraged to complete their profiles after registration
4. **Testing Multiple Users**: Create multiple test accounts to verify proper data isolation
